I am a Tier 2 Soc Analyst at Solace Cyber. I've a passion for digging in the weeds and getting to the crack of whats going on whether that be a sign in risk, an EDR alert, SIEM traffic alert or anything that might look a bit nasty I'm there for it, I'll dig it out, find out what I can on why it's there, what it's doing and how we can stop it doing that again.
