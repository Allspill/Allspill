 I'm a Tier 2 SOC Analyst at Solace Cyber with a strong passion for threat detection, investigation, and response. Whether it’s a suspicious sign-in, an EDR alert, or unusual SIEM traffic, I dive deep to uncover the root cause, understand its impact, and develop ways to prevent it from happening again. I enjoy getting into the weeds of incidents, learning from every alert, and continuously improving detection and response strategies.
